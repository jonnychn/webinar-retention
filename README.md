## Understanding the Outputs

### Retention Curve Chart
- Visual representation of how attendee retention changes over the session duration.
- X-axis: Time spent in the session (minutes)
- Y-axis: Retention percentage (%)
- Each point on the curve represents the percentage of original attendees still present at that time.
- Use this to identify critical drop-off points or periods of high engagement.

### Retention Summary Table
- Provides retention percentages at key intervals (typically 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes, and session end).
- Helps quickly assess retention at standard checkpoints.
- Use this to set benchmarks or compare retention across different sessions.

### Retention Data Table
- Detailed minute-by-minute breakdown of retention.
- Columns include:
  - Time Spent (Minutes): Each minute of the session
  - Number of Attendees Remaining: How many attendees were still present
  - Retention (%): Percentage of original attendees remaining
- Use this for in-depth analysis or to export data for further processing.

## Benefits

- No Technical Skills Required: Intuitive interface suitable for all users, regardless of technical background.
- Immediate Results: Get actionable insights within seconds of uploading your data.
- Data Privacy: All processing occurs locally in your browser; no data is uploaded to external servers.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on all modern web browsers without installation.
- Versatile Application: Suitable for various types of timed sessions or events.
- Cost-Effective: Free tool that provides valuable insights without the need for expensive analytics software.
